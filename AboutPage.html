      <p>The Faculty of Environmental Sciences of the University of Jos came into being during the 1979/80 academic
        session with the three foundation departments of Architecture, Building and Geography and Planning. The

        of Naural Sciences up to the end of 1978/79 session. The two other Departments, Architecture and Building,

        departments currently offer undergraduate and postgraduate courses, leading to the B.Sc., M.Sc, M.Phil, and
        Ph.D degrees. At inception, the faculty was planned so that over time, Departments of Estate Management, Urban
        and Regional Planning, Quantity Surveying and Land Surveying, as well as Advanced Cartography, would emerge
        but none of these have been realised to date. The inability of the Faculty to embrace more departments as
        professed in its initial conception is due to inadequate staff, space, equipment and funding.</p>

      <br>

      <p>In addition to the statutory university functions of teaching , research and community service, the faculty
        is expected to produce self-employable professionals in the form of environmental scientists, architects and
        builders and to inculcate in them the values and culture of effective patriotism and nation building.
